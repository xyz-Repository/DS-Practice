Sliding window problems are computational problems in which a fixed/variable-size window is moved through a data structure, typically an array or string, to efficiently process or analyze the continuous subsets of elements. This technique is used to optimize calculations and find patterns, making it a common approach in algorithm design.


 It has problem like to find subarrays or substring with a defined size window or variable size window.
 e.g:-
 Fix size window
 1. Find maximum sum subArray of size 3
 
 Variable size window
 1. Find maximum sum subArray from an Array of size n. (Here window size is not defined)
